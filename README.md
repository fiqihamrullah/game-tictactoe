# Tic Tac Toe

This is my old project and  I only recently started using Git as my portfolio

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Setup
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Each player chooses a symbol, typically X or O.

## Playing the Game
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell of the grid.
3. The first player marks spaces with their symbol, followed by the second player marking spaces with their symbol.
4. The game continues until:
   - One player achieves three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, resulting in a win.
   - The entire grid is filled with symbols, resulting in a draw.
